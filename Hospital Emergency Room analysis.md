##### Key Performance Insights-

1️⃣ Patient Volume \& Trends-



* The ER served 9,216 patients in total, indicating strong facility utilization.



* Daily trend (sparkline) shows consistent patient inflow without extreme peaks, suggesting predictable demand.



2️⃣ Patient Wait Time Performance-



* Average wait time is 35.26 minutes, slightly above the ideal ER benchmark of 30 minutes.



* The 41% delayed cases highlight an area for operational improvement.



* However, the ER is still managing 59% on-time cases, reflecting good process efficiency.



3️⃣ Service Satisfaction



* Patient satisfaction score: 4.99 out of 5, indicating extremely high service quality.



* Minimal variance in daily satisfaction trend → stable patient experience.



4️⃣ Gender-Based Insights



* Patient distribution is nearly equal:

1. Male: 49% (4,487)
2. Female: 51% (4,729)



* This balance indicates no demographic bias in hospital outreach or reporting.



5️⃣ Age-Group Insights



* Top patient groups:



1. 20–29 years: 1,207 patients
   
2. 10–19 years: 1,160 patients
   
3. 30–39 years: 1,191 patients



* &nbsp;Interpretation:



High visits from age 10–39 indicate a younger population requiring ER services (accidents, lifestyle issues, infections).



6️⃣ Admission Status Analysis



* Nearly equal split:

1. Admitted: 4,612 (50.04%)
2. Not Admitted: 4,604 (49.96%)



* Suggests good triaging — only critical cases are admitted.



7️⃣ Department Referral Insights



* Most referrals came from:



* General Practice: 1,840



* Orthopedics: 995



* Cardiology \& Physiotherapy: < 300 each



* Most patients (5,400) needed no referral, meaning:



* They were treated directly in ER



* Or issues were minor (injuries, fever, infection, etc.)



###### &nbsp;High-Value Business Insights-



* Younger age groups contribute 60%+ of ER load — opportunity for preventive health programs.



* 41% delayed attendance suggests ER staffing or workflow improvements needed during peak hours.



* High satisfaction (4.99) despite delays → staff performance is strong.



* Referral trends indicate the need for strengthening Orthopedics \& General Practice support.



###### Recommendations-



1. Reduce wait time by increasing staff during peak hours or triaging quicker.
   
2. Improve patient satisfaction by addressing delay reasons.
   
3. Increase specialist coverage during high-demand slots.
   
4. Explore campaigns focused on injury prevention for younger age groups (20–39).
   
5. Introduce fast-track services for non-critical conditions to reduce congestion
